			<h2 class="clsa">Giraffe</h2>

			<p class="grf">Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>

			<h3 class="clsb">Behavior</h3>

			<p>Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.</p>

			<p>Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.</p>

			<h3 class="clsc">Height and Size</h3>

			<p>Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.</p>
